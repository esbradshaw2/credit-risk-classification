# credit-risk-classification

## Overview of the Analysis
In this analysis, I wanted to develop a machine learning model for credit risk assessment using historical lending data. The purpose was to predict the credit risk of borrowers based on various financial and personal information provided in the dataset. The goal was to create a model that could assist in making informed decisions regarding loan approvals and risk assessment.

The financial information in the data included loan size, interest rate, borrower income, number of accounts, and other relevant variables. I wanted to predict whether a borrower was high-risk or low-risk based on these features.

## Results
Machine Learning Model 1:
Accuracy Score: 0.99
Precision Score: 0.99
Recall Score: 0.99

## Summary
The machine learning model developed for credit risk analysis demonstrated promising performance. With an accuracy score of 99%, precision score of 99%, and recall score of 99%, the model showed very strong predictive capabilities in identifying creditworthy borrowers.

Based on these results, I definitely recommend using this machine learning model for credit risk assessment. It showed a balance between precision and recall, and was effective in predicting credit risk accurately. This model can provide valuable insights for making informed decisions regarding loan approvals and managing credit risk.
