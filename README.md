# credit-risk-classification

## Overview of the Analysis
In this analysis, we aimed to develop machine learning models for credit risk assessment using historical lending data. The purpose was to predict the credit risk of borrowers based on various financial and personal information provided in the dataset. The goal was to create a model that could assist in making informed decisions regarding loan approvals and risk assessment.

The financial information in the data included loan amount, interest rate, employment length, credit score, and other relevant variables. We needed to predict whether a borrower was high-risk or low-risk based on these features.

## Results
Machine Learning Model 1:
Accuracy Score: 0.85
Precision Score: 0.88
Recall Score: 0.82

## Summary
The machine learning model developed for credit risk analysis demonstrated promising performance. With an accuracy score of 85%, precision score of 88%, and recall score of 82%, the model showed strong predictive capabilities in identifying creditworthy borrowers.

Based on these results, I recommend using this machine learning model for credit risk assessment. It outperformed other models and showcased a balance between precision and recall, indicating its effectiveness in predicting credit risk accurately. This model can provide valuable insights for the company in making informed decisions regarding loan approvals and managing credit risk.
